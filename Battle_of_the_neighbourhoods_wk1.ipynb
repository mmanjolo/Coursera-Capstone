    "London is one of the world's largest tech centres and a sought-after destination for millennials from all over the world looking to make a mark. A city as large and as modern as London offers several opportunities for growth and is renowned for its high standard of life. This also makes a challenge for prospective immigrants to find a home they can purchase and start a life in.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project we will try to find the optimal neighbourhood to buy a home. We will focus on potential homeowners looking to buy a home in London, England. One of the most important considerations is the proximity to Central London, as well as affordability. The intended audience are young millennials moving to the UK with a moderate-income base, looking to buy a 2 bedroomed flat in or around the Greater London Area. We will do this by creating clusters of neighbourhoods in London based on selected amenities and average real estate prices."
